Take-home
Take-home for product roles at humans&
Goal
Build a web application that uses AI facilitate collaboration and communication between
people, teams and organizations.
The app should use a prompted version of Claude as the "collaborator" model that
facilitates interactions between users.
Please spend a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 8 hours on this task.
We're looking for excellence. This is your chance to show us what you can really do —
aim to build something that wows us. Go beyond the basics: thoughtful design, polished
interactions, and a compelling product vision.
Constraints
Use any stack you are comfortable with.
The use of coding agents like Codex is highly encouraged but code quality will be
assessed.
The app should have clear instructions for how we can run it or ideally be hosted
somewhere (e.g. Vercel, Render, etc.) so we can see it in action.
You will be given an Anthropic API key to use for the app and for Claude Code / Cursor.
Write-up
A write-up is required alongside the application. It should cover:
Product vision — What you built and why. Explain the product, the problem it solves,
and the user experience you were aiming for.
Thesis — Your perspective on how AI should facilitate collaboration between people,
teams, and organizations and how your MVP fits into that vision.
Tradeoffs — What tradeoffs did you make given the time constraints? What would you
do differently with more time?

Engineering decisions — Why you chose the stack, architecture, and patterns you did.
What alternatives did you consider?
How we will evaluate your app
We set a high bar — we want to see work that reflects real craft and product intuition.
Specifically, we're looking for:
Extensibility and readability of the code — Is it clean, well-structured, and easy to
build on?
Creative AI-human collaboration — Does the app use AI in a way that genuinely
enhances how people work together, not just as a bolt-on?
Polish and UX — Does the app feel finished? Do the details show care and
intentionality?
Beautiful simplicity — Does AI enable a leaner UX? The best AI products cut down on
screens, form fields, and friction because the intelligence does the heavy lifting — fewer
steps and less cognitive load.
Robustness of the stack — Would this architecture scale? Would it increase developer
velocity?
The best submissions will feel like the seed of a real product, not just a demo.
