    "body": "Summary: Bug report describes useDeferredValue getting stuck on a stale value, especially in production builds, in a repro involving rendering JSX from a server action and resolving promises inside Suspense. A workaround mentioned is forcing periodic re-renders (e.g., a ticker) to unstick the tree, but that is not ideal. Relevance: if our app uses deferred rendering or promise-based UI updates, this issue is a reminder to validate behavior in prod builds and to keep a simple fallback path when 'deferred' UI fails to converge.",

The issue hypothesizes a mismatch between AUTO prefetch cache key (pathname only) and navigation cache key (pathname + params), causing misses. Workaround: set prefetch={true} on Links that include search params so the prefetch entry keys with params from the start.",

For self-hosters behind CloudFront, this prevents edge compression because CloudFront requires Content-Length to compress origin responses. The report points to a template change that wraps JSON in Buffer.from(...), making the response appear 'dynamic' to RenderResult and skipping header generation. Relevance: if we self-host or rely on CDN compression, we should validate headers after upgrades and include regression checks for response metadata.",
